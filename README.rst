`pwclient` is a VCS-agnostic tool for interacting with `Patchwork`__, the
web-based patch tracking system.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install `pwclient` and its dependencies is using ``pip``. To
do so, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install pwclient

You can also install `pwclient` manually. First, install the required
dependencies. On Fedora, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo dnf install python-pbr

On Ubuntu, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get install python-pbr

Once dependencies are installed, clone this repo and run ``setup.py``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/getpatchwork/pwclient
   $ cd pwclient
   $ sudo python setup.py install

Getting Started
---------------

To use `pwclient`, you will need a `.pwclientrc` file, located in your home
directory (``$HOME`` or ``~``). Patchwork itself provides sample `.pwclientrc`
files for projects at ``/project/{projectName}/pwclientrc/``. For example,
`here`__ is the `.pwclientrc` file for Patchwork itself.

More information on the format of the `.pwclientrc` file can be found in the
`documentation`__.
